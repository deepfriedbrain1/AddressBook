# AddressBook

The AddressBook class manages a collection of Person objects.
An AddressBook object will allow the programmer to add, delete, or
search for a Person object in the address book. The user can
specify the size of the address book when it is created.
Default size is set to 50 Person objects. This class will follow
the single-task object (STO or cohesion) principle. 

NOTE: this class uses a fixed array to demonstrate the handling of 
      an array overflow condition.
